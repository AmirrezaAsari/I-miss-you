# I Miss You â€“ Chat Agent Project

## Overview
This project is an experimental AI agent that can chat in the style of a person using historical conversation data.  
The dataset is based on **Telegram exports** (screenshots and text), which are preprocessed into a structured format before being fed into models for training or retrieval.  

The long-term goal of this project is to create a chatbot that mimics conversational patterns, style, and personality extracted from past chats.

## Data Preparation (`data.py`)

The `data.py` script handles cleaning and structuring raw Telegram data.

### Responsibilities:
- **Parsing raw chat exports**: JSON/text exports from Telegram (and later, screenshots converted to text).  
- **Normalizing fields**: user, message, timestamp, type (text, sticker, gif, voice, etc.).  
- **Metadata extraction**:  
  - Timestamps (where available)  
  - Media type (gif, music, sticker, image)  
  - Optional metadata (titles, captions, file names)  
- **Output format**: JSON/CSV ready for downstream tasks.

### Example output (simplified):
```json
{
  "id": "msg_123",
  "sender": "You",
  "text": "Hey, how are you?",
  "timestamp": "2023-05-12 14:35:00",
  "type": "text"
}
Media messages include metadata:

Copy code
{
  "id": "msg_124",
  "sender": "Her",
  "type": "music",
  "title": "Song Name",
  "file": "track123.mp3",
  "timestamp": "2023-05-12 14:37:00"
}
Purpose & Flow
Collect Data
Export from Telegram (.json or text), extract from screenshots if needed.

Prepare Data
Run data.py â†’ outputs normalized dataset in data/processed/.

Embed Data
Store message embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, or Pinecone).

Chat Agent

User sends a message.

System retrieves similar past messages (context) via vector search.

Agent replies in the style/personality of the past chat partner.

Future Additions

More metadata (voice, gifs, music).

Personality profiling.

Telegram-style UI for interaction.

Fine-tuning or RAG pipelines for stronger contextual accuracy.

How to Run
Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare data
bash
Copy code
python data.py
This generates cleaned JSON/CSV in data/processed/.

Next steps
Build embeddings (src/retriever/).

Set up chat agent (src/agent/).

Connect to UI (src/ui/).

Notes
Some chat messages (like from screenshots) may lack timestamps.
These can still be used for personality/style learning, but are less useful for time-based context.

Data will grow as more exports are added. Just rerun data.py to regenerate.

Roadmap
 Add proper timestamp support (when available).

 Support for gifs, music, voice with metadata.

 Implement vector DB + retriever pipeline.

 Build personality-aware response generation.

 Simple web/desktop UI.

Do you want me to also **add a sample `requirements.txt`** (basic stuff like `pandas`, `numpy`, `mammoth`, `pillow`, maybe a vector DB lib), so you have a starting point?

can you give it in .md format?
